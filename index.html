        It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
        The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, 
        who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows 
        great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
        and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither 
        know victory nor defeat.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Yousef Mardrosyan, a Computer Science student at Oakland University. I was born in Amman, Jordan, but I've been living in Michigan since 
                I was five. At university, I work as a grader and a research assistant in the Computer Science department. It's a great experience that lets me 
                dive deep into the field I'm passionate about.
                <br/>
                My goal is to become a Full Stack Software Engineer. I love the idea of working on both the front-end and back-end of software projects. Outside 
                of my studies, I'm really into gaming. I play games like Valorant, Minecraft, and Rocket League. They're fun and sometimes even give me new ideas 
                for my tech projects. If you're interested in learning more about me, feel free to check out my other pages.
